## Insights and Use Cases ðŸš€

These dashboards provide actionable insights into supply chain management, enabling businesses to:

### 1. **Revenue Optimization**:
   - Identify high-performing product categories such as **Skincare**, which has the highest manufacturing cost but generates significant revenue.
   - Optimize pricing strategies based on product performance and revenue data.

### 2. **Inventory Management**:
   - Track stock levels by product type to avoid overstocking or understocking.
   - Improve inventory turnover rates by analyzing slow-moving and fast-moving products.

### 3. **Operational Efficiency**:
   - Evaluate shipping carriers based on delivery times (e.g., Carrier B has the longest shipping time, which could impact on-time delivery rates).
   - Optimize shipping routes to reduce transportation costs (e.g., Route C has the lowest shipping cost but may impact delivery efficiency).

### 4. **Customer-Centric Approach**:
   - Analyze lead times by product type to improve customer satisfaction (e.g., Cosmetics have the shortest average lead time).
   - Tailor strategies based on customer behavior and order patterns segmented by location and gender.

### 5. **Quality and Manufacturing Improvement**:
   - Monitor defect rates and their impact on manufacturing lead times to identify bottlenecks in production.
   - Reduce manufacturing costs while maintaining quality by analyzing cost trends across product types.
